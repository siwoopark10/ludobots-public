The creature has a spine like the one used in assignment 6, but now it has arms and leg that 

Generates a kinematic chain (a jointed, motorized, innervated, sensorized snake) with a:

 - random number (between 4 and 10) of

 - randomly shaped links (cube dimensions range from 0 to 1) with

 - random sensor placement along the chain.
 
 - Links with and without sensors are colored green and blue, respectively.
 
 The vertabrae extend in the y-direction, and the arms and legs expand in the x and z direction.
