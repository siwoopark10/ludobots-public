The robot is designed to look like a puppy climbing up the stairs. 

The robot is trained to climb up as many stairs as possible. The fitness function returns the final y position of the robot, 
so the final version of the robot would have traveled the farthest in the y-direction.

8 different robots evolve over 8 generations, and the best performing robot becomes the final robot.
