The robot is designed to look like a puppy climbing up the stairs. 

The robot is trained to climb up as many stairs as possible. The fitness function returns the final y position of the robot, 
so the final version of the robot would have traveled the farthest in the y-direction.

Compared to the quadruped, the force generated by each motor neuron is more powerful so that the robot can generate more "bounce"
to go up the stairs.

The head, ears, and tail have no mass so that they don't affect the balance of the robot.

8 different robots evolve over 8 generations, and the best performing robot becomes the final robot.
